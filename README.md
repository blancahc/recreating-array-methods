# recreating-array-methods
This is an exercise for the Watch and Code testing series. 
Process:
1. Read the MDN documentation to learn what the native method does
2. Play with it on the DOM. 
3. If necessary, write a prototype
4. Write examples of what it should do
5. Write the english for each test. Think of edge cases. Make them all fail. 
6. Make each test pass one at a time by writing out your function.
